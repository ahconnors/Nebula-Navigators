# Description:
### Nebula Navigators is a python game that we created for the AuburnHacks 2024 Hackathon. This game is built using the pygame native library, meaning the movement, physics and collision handling system was created in the 24 hour span of the hackathon. In this game, we have set the framework for players to explore a randomly generated space environment, gather resources, and manage them as they progress. The planets are randomly assigned attributes such as location, color, and mass, ensuring a unique experience with every playthrough. Our custom physics engine adds a dynamic challenge by making each planet's gravity influence the player’s rocket based on its mass. Thanks for visiting! Read on to learn how to play Nebula Navigators.
